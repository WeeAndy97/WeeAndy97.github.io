/* Anaerobic digestion, data-driven worked examples.
   Six real biogas / biomethane businesses, one template. Scene config from

   720x520 scene coords: digester tanks with breathing gas-holder domes, a
   feedstock reception, a gas-upgrading skid and a grid-injection point (or a CHP
   engine), and a digestate store. This is a production + incentive business:
   revenue is biomethane produced (capacity × hours × load factor) × an
   incentive-rich price, plus a gate fee for accepting feedstock, against the
   cost of feedstock and parasitic load, and the returns model is a simplified
   DCF. The green incentive (GGSS/RHI, LCFS/RIN/45Z) does most of the work in the
