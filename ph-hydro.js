/* Pumped-hydro storage (long-duration storage), data-driven worked examples.
   Six real pumped-hydro schemes, one template. Scene config from ph-geo.js (GEO),
   drawn as a pumped-hydro scheme in 720x520 scene coords: an upper reservoir high
   on the canvas, a lower reservoir below, a penstock / tunnel down a hillside, a
   powerhouse / turbine hall between them, and a grid switchyard with transmission
   lines. Water flows DOWN the penstock when generating (discharging, cyan/white;
   power OUT to the grid, amber/green pulses) and UP when pumping (charging, cyan
   pulses IN) on a slow, alternating cycle; the upper-reservoir level rises and
   falls slightly. Flow intensity scales with the revenue capture.
   The economics are a per-MW revenue-stack model, annual revenue PER MW of power
   from energy arbitrage, capacity payments and system services, against a light
   O&M cost base, with a strong contracted (cap-and-floor / capacity / regulated)
   floor reflecting pumped hydro's very long life; the returns model is a
   simplified DCF. Pumped hydro is the long-duration, long-life cousin of a
   battery: huge power AND many hours of duration, very high civil capex, very low
   opex, and a lower, steadier return than a merchant battery. */
