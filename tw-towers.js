/* Mobile towers (towercos), data-driven worked examples.
   Six real tower companies, one template. Scene config from tw-geo.js (GEO),
   drawn as a daytime landscape dotted with mobile towers (masts) in a 720x520
   scene. The interactive figures are illustrative: a towerco is a colocation /
   tenancy annuity, it owns the towers and leases space to mobile-operator
   tenants. Per-tower opex (ground lease, power, maintenance) is largely fixed,
   so each ADDED tenant drops to EBITDA at close to 100% incremental margin. The
   engine is the tenancy ratio (tenants per tower) × rent per tenancy × towers,
   and the returns model is a simplified DCF on a long, indexed, near-zero-churn
   lease book that trades at a very high EBITDA multiple. */
