/* Green hydrogen, data-driven worked examples.
   Six real electrolytic (green) H2 projects, one continent each, one template.
   Scene config from hy-geo.js (GEO), drawn top-down in 720x520 scene coords: a
   renewable power source (solar / wind) feeds power into a row of electrolyser
   stacks that fizz with H2 bubbles when running, then on to storage tanks and an
   offtake (pipeline / truck / ship / ammonia). This is the GREEN-HYDROGEN SPREAD
   business: revenue is H2 sold (load factor × hours × electrolyser MW × kg/MWh)
   × the H2 price, with a contracted offtake floor; the dominant cost is the
   ELECTRICITY input, so the margin is the thin, power-cost-sensitive spread
   between the H2 price and the power needed. The returns model is a simplified
   DCF. Green H2 leans on grants/PTC/IPCEI and an offtake floor to work at all. */
