/* Fibre networks (FTTH/FTTP), data-driven worked examples.
   Six real fibre builders, one template. Scene config from fb-geo.js (GEO),
   drawn as a top-down fibre access network in a 720x520 scene: a headend /
   exchange (OLT) at one side feeds a fibre spine down the streets to a grid of
   homes. The fibre PASSES every home, a large, fixed cost, but the operator
   earns only on the homes that actually CONNECT (take-up / penetration). The
   interactive figures are illustrative: a fibre builder's profitability is ALL
   about PENETRATION, most network opex is per-home-PASSED, so at low penetration
   the fixed cost swamps the revenue (the altnet risk) and at high penetration the
   margin re-rates. This is the PENETRATION FLYWHEEL. Revenue here is modelled as
   connected homes × ARPU; the returns model is a simplified DCF in which a public
   or rural subsidy offsets part of the cost of passing the homes. */
