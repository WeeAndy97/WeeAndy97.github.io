/* Offshore wind, data-driven worked examples.
   Six real (and a couple of illustrative, early-stage) offshore wind generators,
   one template. Scene config from of-geo.js (GEO), drawn as a sea-level / top-down
   offshore wind farm in 720x520 scene coords: an array of turbines standing in the
   sea, an offshore substation platform collecting the array, and a subsea export
   cable to a shore connection. This is a CONTRACTED, CAPITAL-HEAVY generator:
   revenue is generation (capacity × hours × capacity factor) × power price/strike,
   floored by a CfD / long PPA (so revenue holds when the price slider drops), and
   the returns model is a simplified DCF. Offshore is capital-intensive (high
   capex per MW), so the unlevered IRR is modest but project finance / high
   leverage lifts the levered return. */
