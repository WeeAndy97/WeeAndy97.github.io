/* Nuclear power, data-driven worked examples.
   Six real (and one illustrative) nuclear generation businesses, one template.
   Scene config from nu-geo.js (GEO), drawn as a nuclear power station in 720x520

   body of cooling water, big cooling towers emitting slow rising steam, and a
   switchyard with transmission lines carrying the steady output away.

   The economics are firm baseload generation: an enormous up-front capex and a
   long build, then decades of near-constant output (a very high, steady capacity
   factor) sold under a long contract, a CfD, a RAB, a regulated cost-of-service
   tariff or a long PPA. Revenue is capacity × hours × capacity factor × price,
   floored by the contract; fuel cost is low per MWh but fixed O&M is substantial.
   The returns model is a simplified DCF: the huge capex is the story, and the
   contract is what makes it financeable. */
