/* Schools (PPP / PFI), data-driven worked examples.
   Six real schools public-private partnerships (availability PPPs / PFIs and
   P3 programmes), one template. Scene config from sk-geo.js (GEO), drawn as a
   top-down / elevation school campus in a 720x520 scene: one or two school
   buildings with rows of lit classroom windows, a playground / sports pitch, a
   covered entrance and a small bus drop-off, with a local-authority icon paying
   the availability fee. The interactive figures are illustrative: revenue is a
   contracted government annuity (pupil places × unitary charge × availability),
   with NO demand risk, it is an availability payment, cut only by deductions for
   unavailability or performance, and floored at the contracted minimum. The returns
   model is a simplified DCF in which a public contribution offsets the capital. */
