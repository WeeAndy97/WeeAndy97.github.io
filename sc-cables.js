/* Subsea cables, data-driven worked examples.
   Six real submarine-cable systems, one template. Scene config from sc-geo.js (GEO),
   drawn as a top-down premium OCEAN scene in 720x520 scene coords: a blue sea, a
   landmass and a cable landing station on each edge, and a submarine fibre cable
   laid across the seabed between them with mid-ocean repeaters. Bright data pulses
   travel along the cable both ways, scaling with FILL; faint parallel fibre pairs
   light up in proportion to fill. The interactive figures are illustrative: a
   submarine cable has a large fixed build cost, then sells CAPACITY (lit Tbps ×
   fill × price per Gbps per month) to carriers and hyperscalers, increasingly on
   long-term / IRU contracts, so a large share of revenue is contracted (a high
   floor). Subsea is high-margin, O&M is mostly fixed against the capacity line,
   and the returns model is a simplified DCF in which a consortium / hyperscaler
   contribution offsets part of the build cost. */
