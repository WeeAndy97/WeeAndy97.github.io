/* Student accommodation (PBSA), data-driven worked examples.
   Six real / illustrative purpose-built student accommodation businesses, one
   template. Scene config from st-geo.js (GEO), drawn as an elevation of a student
   accommodation block in a 720x520 scene: a grid of room windows where OCCUPIED
   rooms are lit (a warm desk lamp) and empty rooms dark, so the lit fraction is
   occupancy; a ground-floor common room / reception / gym amenity; a courtyard;
   and a few students and bikes outside. The interactive figures are illustrative:
   PBSA is OPERATIONAL REAL ESTATE, not an availability PPP, revenue is
   occupancy × rent (beds × rent per week × tenancy weeks), so there is genuine
   demand / re-letting risk as well as rental growth and operating leverage. The
   returns model is a simplified DCF / LBO with a cap-rate-based (multiple) exit. */
