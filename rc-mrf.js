   screen, optical sorters, a magnet / eddy-current separator) to an output end
   of stacked bales of sorted commodities, with a residue skip for the reject

   it accepts (the stable core, often under contract with councils / collectors)
   and merchant COMMODITY sales of the recovered materials (paper, baled plastics,
   aluminium, steel, whose prices are volatile). Revenue is tonnes × (gate fee +
   commodity value × recovery), against the cost of sorting (labour, power, residue
   disposal, transport), with a contracted gate-fee floor; the returns model is a
   simplified DCF. The investment story is the gate fee + a commodity-price call. */
